# Mips Processor
### ALU
- The ALU is essential to the implementation of the MIPS processesor 
- We implemented a 32 bit ALU that can handle R, I, and J type instructions
- Our ALU can preform the operations add, sub, and, or, nor
- Operations such as lw, sw, beq are built upon the basic operations add, sub
- It will preform operations based on the input values and yield a result value
